## **1. Problem Statement**

Handling small day-to-day money situations as a student isn’t as easy as it sounds.
Whenever we go out in groups, splitting bills becomes confusing.
People forget who owes what.
Many students also forget their subscription renewals (OTT, gym, software, etc.).
And almost everyone wants to save money but doesn’t really know where to start or what to follow.

So the idea behind this project was to build something simple that helps with all these small but important things in one place, without making it complicated.

## **2. Scope of the Project**

This project focuses only on very basic and practical finance tasks that students commonly deal with.
PocketPilot does NOT aim to be a professional finance app or budgeting tool.
It simply provides:

* a basic bill splitter
* a way to maintain subscriptions
* a simple debt/lend tracker
* and a list of useful resources for saving money

Everything runs in the console so that the code stays easy to understand, especially for first-semester students who are still learning Python.

## **3. Target Users**

The main users are **college students** or anyone who wants a clean and minimal program to handle:

* group expense splits
* remembering subscription dates
* keeping track of who owes whom
* finding beginner-friendly money-saving materials

Basically, anyone who wants a small “helper tool” for everyday pocket money tasks.

## **5. Summary**

PocketPilot is basically a simple console-based assistant that tries to make common student finance tasks easier.
The goal was to build something practical but still small enough for a first-semester Python project.
All the modules are kept separate, the code is easy to follow, and everything is stored in plain text/CSV so that anyone can read or edit it.
